    <h1>Professional Code of Ethics</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Professional Code of Ethics (hereinafter referred to as the "Code") establishes behavioral standards and ethical norms for all members of the organization. Its purpose is to foster a culture of integrity, responsibility, and respect, while strengthening the organization's reputation as a reliable and consistent partner in the business community.</p>
        
        <p>The Code is a mandatory document for review and signature by all organization participants, including cluster leaders and new members. Compliance with its provisions is an essential condition for participation in the organization's activities. The document publicly declares our values and principles, demonstrating commitment to high professional standards.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>The organization's activities are based on the following fundamental values:</p>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>1. Integrity and Responsibility</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Organization members must fulfill their promises and commitments, even when they become disadvantageous.</p>
                <p>If conditions change, new arrangements must be agreed upon with partners or original commitments must be honored.</p>
                <p>Every word must be backed by action. If feedback is promised, it must be provided on time, even if information is currently unavailable - in which case new deadlines should be specified.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>2. Reputation and Honor</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>The reputation of the organization and its members is a priority. Each participant's actions should contribute to maintaining and enhancing the organization's good name.</p>
                <p>We strive to be known as reliable partners whose words and actions are consistent.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="principle">
            <h3>3. Courtesy and Tact</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Members must demonstrate respect and politeness in all interactions, avoiding arrogance, inaccessibility, and ostentatious ambition.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>4. Feedback</h3>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>As the organization's influence and transaction volume grow, leaders' responsibility increases.</p>

                <p>The organization expects high levels of self-discipline and consistency.</p>
            </div>

                <p>The organization will not defend members who violate the Code, regardless of their status or personal connections.</p>
